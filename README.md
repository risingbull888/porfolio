# Final Portfolio Website

### Link to Deployed Website
If you used the stencil code, this is `https://risingbull888.github.io/portfolio`

### Goal and Value of the Application
The website showcases the projects created during the CS1300, having links to previous work and information for contact

### Usability Principles Considered
To make the portfolio easiest to navigate, there is a clear card system with each portfolio with popups with about me, cv and contact information. There is also a light/dark mode switcher for different theme preferences on the user side
